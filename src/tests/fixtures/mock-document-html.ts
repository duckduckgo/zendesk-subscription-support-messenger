  '<p><strong>DuckDuckGo Subscription Support Zendesk AI Agent Notice</strong></p><p>DuckDuckGo Subscription, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”), a subsidiary of Duck Duck Go, Inc., (“DuckDuckGo”), offers an optional automated AI Agent powered by Zendesk, Inc. (the “Agent”) to provide always-available customer support to subscription users. As Zendesk is a third party, the information that you submit to the Agent is transmitted to Zendesk, though we’ve engineered our Zendesk integration to minimize the use of your personal information (see below). However, if you’d rather not use the Agent at all, that’s totally fine: you can contact our human support team <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/subscription-support">here</a>, who tries to respond to requests within two (2) business days.</p><p><strong>We minimize the amount of personal information the Agent uses.</strong></p><p>The Agent operates on a separate subdomain to isolate any data it collects. Due to the nature of customer support, the Agent inevitably collects some personal information, such as the content of support requests and conversations, as well as automated data (such as logs, feedback signals, and other metadata mentioned below). Zendesk is configured to aggregate and/or remove certain types of personal information to prevent it from being processed, such as bank account numbers, credit cards, and social security numbers, though this does not guarantee complete “anonymization” or removal of all personal information submitted to the Agent. We’ve also taken steps to prevent the third party Zendesk script (the “script”) from storing potentially sensitive data in the DuckDuckGo browser beyond the support chat session. </p><p><strong>We only collect anonymous interaction data so we can better serve you.</strong></p><p>To evaluate and improve our automated support experience, we only collect limited, non-identifying (anonymous) information. For example, if you click the ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ button when asked if our subscription support is helpful, that sends an isolated Yes/No signal to us, but none of this information is connected to you as an individual.</p><p><strong>We (humans) are here to assist you whether or not you use the automated Agent.</strong></p><p>You have the option to escalate any support request to a (human) support representative. If you do so via the automated Agent, any personal information shared with the Agent, including conversation transcripts, will be shared with the DuckDuckGo support representative. </p><p><strong>Zendesk collects and processes customer support data.</strong></p><p>As noted above, Zendesk collects information submitted through the Agent and the script, processing it to automate conversations, provide analytics, and improve the service. Zendesk also collects other information related to your support session, such as page impressions, consent preferences, and errors. Chat-related information is deleted from Zendesk’s servers after 90 days.</p><p>Zendesk uses local storage as necessary for the Agent to function. For example, a client identifier is stored to recognize a returning user so you can continue a conversation where you left off. All local storage items are cleared when you clear your browser’s web storage or use the Fire Button.</p><p>See Zendesk’s <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/trust-center/#privacy">privacy policy</a> for more information on Zendesk.</p><p><strong>Your data will not be used to train third party or Zendesk models.  </strong></p><p>To improve the effectiveness of our automated support experience, Zendesk uses limited customer support data from interactions with the Agent to help refine response accuracy and enhance service performance.  However, this data is only used to improve the DuckDuckGo support experience. Our agreement with Zendesk prohibits this data from being used for training AI models accessible to other Zendesk customers or any third-party model. </p><p><strong>Zendesk may transfer your information.</strong></p><p>Zendesk uses other service providers to provide its support services, resolve system issues, and provide security and infrastructure, and your information will be processed by some or all of those service providers. Zendesk has committed to requiring its service providers to follow specific data protection obligations. See Zendesk’s <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408883061530__;!!LBFcHN3WCgnqDQ!mYjGBy3SEzB9y_L-BOpzwTRD-RFhR2Iuxb59GN3TymPWv9kOKzAkQXgo4d-H0lmGMsBfTX2vaMhxM0teFoAo5FAW6okl$">Sub-processor Policy</a> for more information. If you are located outside of the U.S., your information may be transferred to the U.S. for processing. </p><p>DuckDuckGo’s <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/pro/privacy-terms">Subscription Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</a> also applies. If there\'s a conflict with the DuckDuckGo <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/pro/privacy-terms">Subscription Privacy Policy and Terms of Service</a> (and/or another DuckDuckGo privacy policy) and this policy, the terms of this policy will prevail. </p><p><em>By selecting “Continue to Chat”, you acknowledge and consent to the following:</em></p><p>I have read, understand, and consent to DuckDuckGo’s Subscription Support Zendesk Agent Notice and understand that a third party (Zendesk) script will be loaded and the Agent will be enabled for my device. I can withdraw consent by clicking the Fire Button associated with the Agent.  This will reset the Agent and clear my storage, including chat and chat-related local storage items.</p><p>If you do not wish to continue, click “Cancel”.</p><p>[<strong>Continue to Chat</strong>]     [Cancel]</p><p> </p><p>Last updated: [UPDATE WITH DATE POSTED]</p>';
